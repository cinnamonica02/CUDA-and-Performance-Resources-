## Getting Started

Instructions on how to use this repository.

### Prerequisites


### Ideal Set-up : Running locally

*   NVIDIA GPU with CUDA support
*   CUDA Toolkit installed
*   (Optional) Docker for CUTLASS development


### No GPU ? Dont let that discourage you! 

* You can run cuda kernels on google colab
* There are also more affordable GPU cloud instances like runpod.io, lambda labs , vast.ai etc
* Currently the discord channel of Umar Jamil is running a 100 days of cuda ,
- you may be able to get sponsors if you cook everyday there, 
- everything is possible when you build consistently in public!
